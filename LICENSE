     persons who the copyright has been transferred to by the original authors
     or their descendants.

     instructions, photographs, video guides, and bill of materials.

1. SCOPE OF THE LICENSE: The License applies to the Project Files as defined
above. It does not apply to the circuits themselves since they are not
protected by copyright law in most jurisdictions. The License applies only to
the version of the Project Files identified above. The Copyright Holders
reserve the right to relicense further versions of the Project Files under a
different license.

2. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND: While every reasonable effort has been made to
ensure that the PCB artworks, circuit diagrams and accompanying documentation
are free of substantial errors, the Project Files are provided with no warranties
whatsoever, whether implied or explicit, including (but not limited to) the
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

3. NO COMPENSATION OF ANY KIND: In no event unless agreed to in writing shall the
Copyright Holders be liable to you for damages of any kind, including any
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of your use or
inability to use the Project Files. Should the Project Files require any
remedial works to be usable, the cost of any and all such works shall be borne
by you, including (but not limited to) the cost of creating new PCB designs,
ordering new PCBs or sourcing additional components.

4. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK: Assembling electronic apparatuses of any kind,
especially those that are mains-powered, carries an inherent risk of injury,
potentially leading to death. It is generally assumed that any such activity
should be undertaken only by suitably qualified persons. If you attempt to use
the Project Files to build your own electronic devices, you do so entirely at
your own risk. In no event shall the Copyright Holders be held responsible for
your safety and well-being.

remove the aforementioned notices and identification marks from the PCB artworks
or any finished products based on the Project Files.

6. REDISTRIBUTION: You are free to redistribute the Project Files provided that:
   a) you do not modify them in any way; and
   b) you preserve the README file, license information and any and all
      copyright notices included with the project.

7. NO DERIVATIVE WORKS: You are not allowed to create derivative works (i.e.
works that are substantially based on one or more of the Project Files) without
an express written permission of the Copyright Holders.

8. FREE FOR BOTH COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE: The Copyright Holders hereby
grant you the right to use the Project Files for both non-commercial and
commercial purposes (including, but not limited to, assembling finished products
for sale) provided that you observe the terms and conditions of this License and
that your use of the Project Files does not violate any applicable laws and
regulations.
